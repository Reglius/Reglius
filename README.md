Hi, I am Daniel Cook. I use a screen name for my github, @Reglius.

Currently I am in graduate school at UNOmaha, studying Economics with a concentration in Econometrics and Data Analytics!

You can use this page as a directory for my important repositories and their descriptions along with the technology used to create them.

>[Location Checker](https://github.com/Reglius/LocationChecker): This is a data collection project for how many stores a company has in America.
 \- I used Java (with threading!), Gradle, and Google Maps's API for data collection!

>[Zoom Planner](https://github.com/Reglius/localhosts): During my software development class we had a group project that created a calander planner for zoom since they dont have a good one.
 \- Tech used was AWS EC2, Apache, Java, JavaScript, and MongoDb!
 
 >[Dungeon Crawler](https://github.com/Reglius/DungeonCrawler1): As a project for my Game Development class, I made a 2D dungeon crawler, please play it!
 \- This was made with HTML and a whole lotta JavaScript!

Hi, I am Daniel Cook. I use a screen name for my github, @Reglius.

I am a graduate of UNOmaha, having studied Economics with a concentration in Econometrics and Data Analytics in my Graduate Program and Computer Science in my Undergrad!

You can use this page as a directory for my important repositories and their descriptions along with the technology used to create them.

>[Options Trading](https://github.com/Reglius/Stocks): Hoping to beat the stock market with this one, high hopes for it.
 \- Used Python and Trading APIs for my analysis.

>[Location Checker](https://github.com/Reglius/LocationChecker): This is a data collection project for how many stores a company has in America.
 \- I used Java (with threading!), Gradle, and Google Maps's API for data collection.

>[Zoom Planner](https://github.com/Reglius/localhosts): During my software development class we had a group project that created a calander planner for zoom since they dont have a good one.
 \- Tech used was AWS EC2, Apache, Java, JavaScript, and MongoDb.
 
 >[Dungeon Crawler](https://github.com/Reglius/DungeonCrawler1): As a project for my Game Development class, I made a 2D dungeon crawler, please play it!
 \- This was made with HTML and a whole lotta JavaScript.
 
 Below are two of my best papers I wrote in my undergraduate program.
 
 >[Java Concurrency](https://dcnelabs.io/DanielCookISNT.pdf): This paper is a technical report on the benifits of concurrency in programming. This is a high concept level paper written for nontech savvy readers.

 >[Optimization Report](https://dcnelabs.io/DanielCookDetOps.pdf): The second paper is a report on the mathematical formulation of optimizing a toy factory production schedule. The math behind the process can be applied to any process in the real world that can be optimized.
